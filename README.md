# STARTUPS-SUCCESS-OR-FAILURE-ANALYSIS-
 
 
 ABOUT THE PROJECT/ THE ROADMAP:  

The "startups_dataset.csv" file is the original file, the dataset used for the analysis which is "Startups Success/Fail Dataset from Crunchbase". [Credit and License: Community Data License Agreement â€“ Sharing, Version 1.0. I have used MQSQL for all the cleaning, transformation and analysis so "startups" from "new_schema_startups_project.startups" is the uploaded, transfomed and analysed dataset in MYSQL. The questions and topics focussed on the analysis are mentioned below: 


1. Demographic analysis: Analyze the distribution of startups based on geographic location, industry, and funding amount.

2. Funding trends: Analyze the trend of funding over time and compare the funding of startups in different regions, cities, and countries.

3. Success and failure: Analyze the factors that contribute to the success or failure of startups, such as industry, location, and funding amount.

4. Performance analysis: Analyze the performance of startups based on the number of funding rounds, funding amount, and the time between funding rounds.    

5. A summary table that aggregates the funding_total_usd by each country_code, state_code, region, and city. This will allow you to see the total amount of funding that has been raised in each location and potentially identify areas with high funding potential. And, another summary table that aggregates the funding_total_usd by the different funding round stages (operating, closed, acquired, IPO). This would give you a better understanding of which stages are receiving the most funding and where there may be potential opportunities for investment.
